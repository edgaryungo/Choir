# Choir App

The Choir App is a web application inspired by my church choir, designed to streamline choir management and enhance the overall experience for both the youth choir and the main choir. It provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, allowing choir administrators to manage choir members, songs, and performances effectively.

## Key Features

- Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing choir members, songs, and performances.
- Separate sections for the youth choir and the main choir, providing sample songs specific to each group.
- User-friendly interface and intuitive navigation for easy access to the app's features.
- Secure authentication system to ensure only authorized users can access and manage choir data.

## Purpose

As a member of the church choir, I developed this app to simplify choir management tasks and improve the overall choir experience. By digitizing choir-related operations, such as  updating song lists, the Choir App aims to save time, increase efficiency, and enhance communication within the choir.

## Technologies Used

- Front-end: HTML, CSS(bootstrap)
- Back-end: Django
- Database: Mysql
- Authentication: Django Authentication
- Deployment: Railway

Feel free to explore the Choir App and experience the convenience it brings to managing and organizing choir activities.
